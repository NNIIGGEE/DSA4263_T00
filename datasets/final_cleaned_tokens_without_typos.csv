 i know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if i dug into the bag with a cup, i would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  so, there must be a misprint on the box.  i am assuming i measured properly because i have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy mcdonald's breakfast sandwiches. by following the instructions, i have a lot of biscuits.  if you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  you will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly.  this mix cost me around $5.00 and i don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which i will because these biscuits are really, really good.  still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need.<br /><br />about these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color.  even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. if you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  that is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  it will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  the biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.<br /><br />the mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum.  many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  it is not grainy at all; i repeat, it is not grainy at all.  for those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone.  leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  the sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  as for the xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  you will find xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.<br /><br />the other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  you can find more recipes on their website.<br /><br />i recommend this product for the taste.  i do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price."

(they emit a slight hissing sound when they expand).  as soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it's a good sign you have reached the optimal result.  this item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store, but the improved flavor is worth it. to me anyway.  the jury is still out on whether the ""healthy"" claim can hold water.  i will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion.  good eats!"

""where does a person even get lavender soda?""<br /><br />""it was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of marshall's, so i bought it."" brian replied.<br /><br />i walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as i typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. however, i would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience i had hoped it would be.<br /><br />when i took my first sip, i thought to myself, ""what have i gotten myself into this time?"" the initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. ""interesting,"" i thought. ""perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first."" however, as my drinking experience continued, i came to realize that this would not be the case. after i swallowed the soda, i was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. like a bar of soap was in my mouth. this brought back horrible memories of my childhood...<br /><br />you see, when i was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to ""wash my mouth out with soap"" if i either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. being one to always question my mother's conviction, i often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. this had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later i can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when i consider saying a bad word. consequently, when i took my first taste of lavender soda, i was hit with a flood of emotions. i felt as though i had said a bad word or broken a rule. i felt as though i was being punished for something but could not recall what i had done. my vision began to become cloudy. i began to lose control of my small motor functions. i was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. i vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as i shall live, lest i suffer another episode such as the one described above.<br /><br />in summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. it might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but i, personally, do not prefer it."

(grass fed organic ghee is one of those top picks.)<br /><br />because such high quality ghees are available, i focused on understanding which product is the most authentic. some of the ghees are much more authentic than others. the information in the table (link above) reflects that fact.<br /><br />the focus of my evaluation was not gourmet cooking. it was optimum health. therefore, i was concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest.<br /><br />i rank grass fed organic ghee as one of the very best products. grass fed organic ghee is made in accord with the ancient traditions (such as phase of the moon, chanting, etc.). it is a great quality, great tasting product. and the good price makes it a great value. i highly recommend this ghee."

(wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />i think for now i will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />heavens to besty, this stuff rocks!! it is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as i have def shopped around.  i have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  kudos to alive and aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />i am not a raw foodie per say, but i try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, i think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  it is loaded with antioxidants, as you probably know.  so go ahead, get the big bag.  you can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />my favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- i just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, i know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how i love it!), add just enough sweetener (i like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked i top it off with a spoonful of evo coconut oil- yumm!!! i have converted everyone, even the kids i babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). or i make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  you better believe it goes fast!!  i love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins a, d and the x- factor (read weston a price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry i am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />also process it with evo coconut oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  i often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />go for it! buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. i guarantee!!  peace be with you!"

friskies, nine lives, kit & kaboodle, stuff like that. and our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. they would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />my housemate at the time was working for hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. i now know that she is an utter buffoon, but i initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. she also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />i first tried feeding the little bean an unmeasured amount of science diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. so then i took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. then i started parsing it out to twice a day. that didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. so then i split it into three servings. same thing. then it got to be four servings. that was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. so then it went back to three. all the while, i was trying to reduce the amount of food i was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. reducing was hell. she became even more hungry, but i figured she would get used to it. not really.<br /><br />for over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. as soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />we thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. she always wanted food. it was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />a few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since i've had her. i talked with him about her being always hungry. he asked what she ate, and i told him the adult indoor science diet. without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and i should look for something else. he said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. science diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. not that i care about spending money on the bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />so we began transitioning her onto wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. she is still eating 50 percent science diet with 50 percent wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but she never freaks out anymore. it's amazing. and it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts i still regrettable have to feed her. we have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in total. she was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. no more knocking things over, no more trashing dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. it's incredible.<br /><br />i feel so bad that i was doing this to her for so long. we really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. but no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - wellness, halo, innova, evo, whatever. figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. it's garbage."

 are you familiar with the westminster kennel club dog show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for ""best in show,"" including the chinese pug?  do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?<br /> i could talk about the money we paid for greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  and there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  i find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the kroger store from which we purchased your killing busy bone.<br /> i have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  i visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  he certainly appreciates those visits.  but he also has a fulltime companion - spencer, his jack russell terrier.  spencer will turn 12 in may.  dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the cleveland clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  and i believe if it weren't for the loving attention spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  his dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  something which purina has stolen away from us.  you'd think that purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  but tragically that's not the case.<br /> yet there's more.  we also have a male pug which we named winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of winston churchill.  winston, like greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  and like us, he's now subdued.  he's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  this concerns me.<br /> i am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  i work with the general public and i have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  as a result of losing greta, all i can think about now is me handing her a busy bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  the guilt is killing me.  how can i write?  how can i do anything?  grief passes they say.  but tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  and what makes things worse in this case is that greta's death could have been prevented.<br /> though both winston and greta liked the busy bone, several times in the past greta had gagged on it.  so, i served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation i assumed resolved the problem.  in retrospect i should have responded more to the concerns lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  in a brief moment, while we were in another room, greta died because of your product.  and why should such a product even exist?  why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  why didn't purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?<br /> the answer is self-evident: gross negligence.  a negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in lori's and my life.  we'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  i lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even i, a writer, cannot express in words.  it's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  we are utterly distraught.  greta, only 2 ¬ω years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  it's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to purina.<br /> the very least purina can do is pull all forms of the busy bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any purina product.<br /><br /> karl and lori<br /> former owners of beloved greta, purebred female pug.  our baby.  gone forever."

'sometimes', 'seemingly']","we breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. we started with similac advance (shield plus) which we still had from hospital. first 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to similac organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-ounce bottle i began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. breast milk and similac advance tested similarly sweet, but similac organic was much much less sweet. i made a research on the internet and i found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/encymaster/c/constipation_infant.html)<br /><br />constipation means infrequent, hard stools. it does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. so the first question to ask is, ""is my child really constipated?""<br /><br />next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. the normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. that is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.<br /><br />conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. it is just that simple.<br /><br />so constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:<br /><br />  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased ""motility,"" we say)<br />  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces<br />  * a combination of the above two factors<br />  * there is obstruction of the lower gi tract<br />  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - hirschprung disease<br />  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation<br />  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage<br /><br />breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. this is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. the stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. and of course a lot of noisy gas. but these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.<br /><br />later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. it is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. by then we are really discussing toddlers.<br /><br />breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. this worries some parents. despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. go figure. they forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.<br /><br />when the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. when the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. the baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. just as mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. hence the grunting and red-faced straining.<br /><br />  the other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.<br /><br />the cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. if one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, i have mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. the anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.<br />top<br /><br />bottle fed infants are ""a whole 'nother story."" infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (the exception to this rule in my mind is the new similac¬æ that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) so true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.<br /><br />the young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. the residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. it is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.<br /><br />the addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. cereal + milk = concrete. cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.<br />top<br /><br />treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:<br /><br />  * again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.<br />  * i use a lot of karo¬æ corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. it is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. i start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. usually, the baby can be weaned off the karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. it is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. the excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. the excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).<br /><br />  before scolding me about ""the risk of botulism"" from corn syrup, please see:<br /><br />  clinical pediatric emergency medicine, volume 4,number 3,september 2003: ""pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember""<br /><br />  ""in the past, c. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.""<br /><br />  for the complete source of statement, see: olsen sj, swerdlow dl. risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. in reply. pediatr infect dis j 2000;19:584-5.<br /><br />  * certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. they can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.<br />  * lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. we use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. the dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.<br />  * glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. the suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. the act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)<br />  * fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (i believe isoyalac¬æ, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. it was never very available any place i practiced, anyway.)<br /><br />top<br /><br />myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:<br /><br />  * iron in the formula causes constipation. no way. i can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. but the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.<br /><br />  the irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.<br /><br />  * increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. the problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (karo¬æ, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.<br /><br />top"

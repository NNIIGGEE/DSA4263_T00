      <td>something to eat if you're starving - but please give real food to hungry people,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what's in kellogg's corn flakes? "milled corn, sugar, malt flavoring, high fructose corn syrup, salt." yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as bht and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities. for nutrition you get basically 100% carbs from lots of sugar and almost no protein. add skim milk, or you'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk. for added nutrition, include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you like corn flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [$3.49 per package]. at this price, the inner package's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff. why not use a vacuum-sealed container like kretschmer's wheat germ to preserve freshness? after all, it's in the same price range!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so if you are hungry, you are really eating the wrong stuff. something to eat if you are starving - but please give real food to other hungry people please!</td>

      <td>sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. i like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. the skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion--regular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me. they are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile--i sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling, mix with egg, oatmeal, onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty, or add them to a salad. although i think these from roland are very good, i liked the seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by amazon, even better for flavor and texture.</td>

(you might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' "spins" on this). good books to get in this regard are "foods pets die for" and "protect your pet":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165562"&gt;food pets die for: shocking facts about pet food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165422"&gt;protect your pet: more shocking facts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their pet promise food was one of the few brands in america that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive "premium brands"). i felt so lucky that i had already switched to pet promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from north american farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i finally discovered halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that ellen degeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. their website also included a specific message written to us former pet promise users. so i went to my health-food store and bought some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are "made in the usa", except the pea protein from canada. furthermore, the salmon in halo is wild alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! making it even more promising than pet promise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. but they love it!!! can't get enough! so i have to dole it out so they don't overeat! and after five months, their health and energy seem to be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, and hi, ellen - and many thanks!</td>

      <td>the oatmeal raisin bars by quaker are a tasty treat, but unlike some bars, they aren't too sweet or too bland. they have enough sweentess to make them flavorful, but don't go to extremes. they are relatively low in fat content (90 calories, 15 fat calories) and pretty convenient to have with you if you just want a quick snack, but don't want anything too heavy. they are also appropriate for any time when you get a little craving for something unhealthy (something you might regret), something like potato chips or cookies. for this reason, they are a healthy alternative to "junk" food. i tend to like to eat them for breakfast, but they are also an excellent "in between" meals snack. in stores, it will cost you about three or four dollars for a pack of 10. i've tried a few of the others kinds made by quaker oats, but these are my favorites.</td>

      <td>i once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  i discovered them when i was in england back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  about a year ago i picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  i was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  after opening the bag i found the chips were not even close to the kettle chips i was used to.  they were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and i was very disappointed.  so i e-mailed kettle with the following:  "what happened? i bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; it tastes "cheaper". i don't know how else to put it... i also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as i did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. i am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. did i just get a weird batch? i have been buying only kettle chips for about 10 years now so i am wondering."  i did receive a reply: "thanks for letting us know about your experience with your kettle brand¬æ chips. it sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!thanks for providing us with the "best before" code from the bag.  this really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.&lt;br /&gt;we are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our kettle brand¬æ flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! in case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  please let me know if i can be of any more help."  well the next bag was good.  since that time i have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the "bad" bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  i did some research and found out that kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  so the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at kettle.  acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  stay away from kettle chips they are no longer the same...</td>

(since i am a raw fooder, i can't tell you how it tastes, but i am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks to these great products, i can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!</td>

(it's sort of a weird taste, takes alot of getting used to)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would i suggest buying them? no. if you're eager to try them, i say buy a bag from your local grocery store. a week or so after i ordered these on here i saw them at m local krogers, so they're definitely expanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nutrition information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, total fat = 3g (5%), sodium = 210 mg (9%), total carbohydrate = 16g (5%), dietary fiber = 1 g (4%), sugar = 2g, protein 1 g, vitamin a , vitamin c, calcium, and iron = 2 %.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you buy a big bag of bbq popchips and big bag of bbq baked lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**pop chips:**&lt;br /&gt;serving size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, calories= 120, total fat = 4.5g (6%), sodium 280mg (11%), total carbohydrate 20g (6%),&lt;br /&gt;dietary fiber 1g (4%), sugars 2g, protein 1g&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**baked lays:**&lt;br /&gt;serving size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, calories = 120, total fat 3g (5%),  sodium 210mg (9%), potassium 230mg, total carbohydrate 22g (7%), dietary fiber 2g 8%, sugars 3g, protein 2g, vitamin c 4%, calcium 2%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so these two are very close, but baked lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of potassium. plus there's more fiber and more vitamin c. and most importantly they taste better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that baked lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but i'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both baked lays and popchips... i can almost guarantee you that baked lays will win hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(hopefully amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of baked lays soon. for now i found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b003tvdhio"&gt;smart mix variety pack, 30-count: 7-baked lay's classic, 6-baked cheetos, 6-baked ruffles, 6-baked doritos nachos cheese &amp; 5-rold gold tiny twists (pack of 2)&lt;/a&gt; )</td>

      <td>took me years to find the ultimate chewing gum, but when i found wrigley's orbit white peppermint the search ended. i've been chewing this gum for many years now, i occasionally try something else, but nothing ever wins. the peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath, and toward the end of its chewable life, it doesn't start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do; it simply loses its flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only drawbacks. i usually chew 2 pieces at a time, so they are a bit small and #2 they just changed the packaging. it used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket, inside suit jacket pocket etc, now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it's bulky. not sure why they had to change; probably to do with retail stores layout. this won't prevent me from buying it, but it's really annoying. wrigley; just never change the flavor!</td>

(not regular chips which can sink to the bottom.) we buy good quality belgian chocolate minichips. this mix is a great alternative if you want less guilt in your guilty pleasures.</td>

      <td>ok--i just bought bisquick gf and the first thing i tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  these are not the kind that are rolled out &amp; cut--these are "drop "biscuits.  the results were very tasty.  the taste of this gf bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  if you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  i noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  i read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each).  the biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. i measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and i don't even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  i know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if i dug into the bag with a cup, i would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  so, there must be a misprint on the box.  i am assuming i measured properly because i have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter &amp; jam, or sliced to make those yummy mcdonald's breakfast sandwiches. by following the instructions, i have a lot of biscuits.  if you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  you will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly.  this mix cost me around $5.00 and i don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which i will because these biscuits are really, really good.  still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;about these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color.  even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. if you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  that is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  it will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  the biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, &amp; xanthum gum.  many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  it is not grainy at all; i repeat, it is not grainy at all.  for those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone.  leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  the sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  as for the xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  you will find xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  you can find more recipes on their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this product for the taste.  i do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price.</td>

      <td>wonderful, smooth, satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor.  no chemical aftertaste, like many decafs i've tried.  apparently, the swiss water process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something i've found terribly disappointing in other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i've been very impressed by the flavor dimensions of this riviera sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  no bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.  believe me, this alone is quite an endorsement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love using my &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b0011528s0"&gt;zojirushi cd-wbc30 micom electric 3-liter water boiler and warmer, champagne gold&lt;/a&gt; for coffee, tea, and cooking.  i brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual melitta brown paper filter &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b001e5e0t2"&gt;melitta cone coffee filters, natural brown, no. 2, 100-count filters (pack of 6)&lt;/a&gt;and filter cone (similar to this one:&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b001794q0s"&gt;ready set joe/mug&lt;/a&gt;) and found that the extra fine grind of the riviera sunset blend imparted an unusually rich, deliciously multidimensional flavor.  much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee.  this method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take time to "bloom the grounds" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for any coffee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;melitta's riviera sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  you'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.  i look forward to ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 9/21/10:  just ordered my first 3-pack through subscribe &amp; save; great deal for some delicious decaf!</td>

      <td>i was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running.  i am 60 years old and about 50 pounds overweight.  i find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  first of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  i was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  i guess with the package calling it honey stinger i was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  still, everything is organic which i suppose should add to it's value.  i found that i felt no energy boost during my activities but i can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going.  it's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going.  i don't like feeling like i'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that.  i think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising.  the only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them.  i will purchase again when my grocery money allows.  i would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy pickup to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost.</td>

      <td>these pork skins have a great taste. very fresh "homemade" taste. the cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though. i have a 1000w microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag. the first bag i tried with 1 minute, and additional 15 second intervls, stopping at 1min, 15 seconds. several skins had not yet cooked. so i rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it 15 more seconds. still some did not fully "explode" or "bloom".  the second bag i started with 1 minute, 30 seconds. slightly better results, but again i needed to re-roll the end of the bag and give it another 15-30 seconds, still using the 15 second intervals for best results.  the third bag i started with 2 minutes (which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting) and the results were not as good. too many had over-cooked and were too hard to eat.&lt;br /&gt;my suggestion would be to stick with the 1 minute with 15 second intervals, listening closely to the sound. (they emit a slight hissing sound when they expand).  as soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it's a good sign you have reached the optimal result.  this item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store, but the improved flavor is worth it. to me anyway.  the jury is still out on whether the "healthy" claim can hold water.  i will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion.  good eats!</td>

      <td>i bought these as a way to supplement my meals, as well as get more fiber and protein.  first of all, these bars are fairly nutritious.  they are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal.  each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein.  considering most people in the united states don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. previously i was eating the fiber one bars oats &amp; chocolate, 5-count boxes (pack of 6).  while you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of protein.  the kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well.  each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn't sound very tasty, these are some of the best bars i've tried.  as the name implies, they're not chewy, but not too crunchy either.  below is the main nutritional info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;calories  180&lt;br /&gt;total fat  5g&lt;br /&gt;  sat fat  2g&lt;br /&gt;sodium  250mg&lt;br /&gt;carbs  30g&lt;br /&gt;  fiber  6g&lt;br /&gt;protein  9g</td>

      <td>these bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. that's actually part of why i like them so much. because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. as a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. i don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. if you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. i also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. the caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. if you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a go-lean roll bar while driving. nevertheless, i still think these are some of the best bars out there. they are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. they really are like fortified candy bars. and they pack quite a high protein and fiber punch for only 190 calories each, while only having about 13 mg of sugars--about 1 tablespoon--per bar (i was expecting more like 25-30 mg when i tried my first one). the chocolate turtle roll is my favorite flavor, but honestly, i've tried every single flavor of the go-lean roll bars, and they are really all quite good.</td>

      <td>this taco bell chipotle sauce is quite enjoyable and has the tangy yet not very spicy taste you would expect. i have used it on burritos and as a dip. there is no question that if you like the flavor of chipotle sauce you will enjoy this. but it is high in calories which i expected and did not mind for you do not need a lot too enjoy the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yet two tablespoons of this sauce contains 100 calories from fat and a total of 110 calories per serving size. the serving size is the aforementioned two tablespoons. it taste great just be aware of its high fat content and calories. when serving size is measured by the spoon full you know the calories are high. and even so, i would get this product again.</td>

      <td>taco bell's bold &amp; creamy chipotle sauce is perfectly described in its name. this is a thick sauce with a strong smoky flavor and although it is quite spicy, there is little heat. i first used it to spice up black beans being served as a side dish for tacos. the beans are so bland, they always need something, and this sauce was the perfect addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the sauce also worked beautifully with falafels - again, just the right amount of spice and it gave the pita bread sandwich stuffed with lettuce, tomato, cucumber and falafel balls a needed jolt. finally, i used the sauce on a veggie burger and it also worked beautifully there, too. i was pleased with the results each time i used it, and found the sauce very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only negative is it not low on calories - two tablespoons have 110 calories and 100 of those are fat calories - so i use it sparingly. that said, it is sufficiently spiced so that a little goes a long way.</td>

      <td>this is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing, and i'll admit it's a rare guilty pleasure for me.  as compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor, i thought this one tasted better, probably because of the already mixed almost-cheese sauce that is included (which also replaces the milk that's usually added).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it's pretty much a toss-up in terms of nutrition, given that we aren't looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here.  as prepared, this one has 350 calories per serving, the other 310.  this has 140 calories from fat, the other 110.  this one has 850 mg of sodium, the other one has 810.  the kraft velveeta cheesy skillet comes out slightly ahead overall, with protein of 8 g compared to the other's 3 g and dietary fiber of 1 g compared to less than a gram for the competitor.  these differences are probably attributable to the "cheese" sauce.  the sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat, with 9 g for this one and 0.5 for the other.  after the ground beef is added, the difference is 25% of the recommended daily amount vs. 19% (virtually none of it "good" fat in either one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat, both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients, meaning they certainly do contain transfat, just less than the half-gram per serving that would require full disclosure.  if you eat the whole package - about 5 cups, so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two, you easily might - you could get whacked with as much as 2.4 g of transfat, not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both.  at 800+ grams of sodium, you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium, too.  you might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but, as i said, it's a guilty pleasure; by definition, that's not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made.  in any case, all other things (price, availability) being equal, i will probably choose this one if i choose it again.</td>

      <td>i love tortilla chips, just good ol' fashioned corn chips with salt on them.  i was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;before even tasting these chips, the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness.  it's tough and a little slippery; i almost couldn't open it by hand.  the chips are little hexagons about 1" in diameter, with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips.  while the corn flavor is dominant, the various other elements of these chips really blend well to give them a unique flavor.  they're not overly salty - indeed, if i had any quibble, it's that a little more salt would be appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these chips would be an excellent choice for finger foods for a higher end dinner party, a date, or just an evening when you want to treat yourself.</td>

      <td>i am munching on these chips as i type, trying to keep the salt off my fingers and from going on the keys. i like the way they taste. the flavors are mainly of stone-ground corn, but you can tell there are other ingredients, as well. there's a nice nutty aftertaste. i like texture, too. just the right amount of crunch.  these chips aren't overly salty, either, another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nutrition-wise, these chips rank among the more healthy versions.  there are only 140 calories in a one ounce serving, a lot less than the normal 200+ i see on similar products, and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower, too. it's got 3g of fiber = 11% of an average daily requirement. there are no trans fats cholesterol, preservatives, etc.  it seems that the foodshouldtastegood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale.  my own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip.  the expiration date on the bag is in november.  with no preservatives, it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only hesitation would be the price.  currently these chips aren't in stock on amazon and there is no pricing given so i would say you'd have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips, even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good, as well.</td>

      <td>i just got home from a long trip and was faced with making dinner.  luckily, the velveeta cheesy skillet dinner was sitting in my pantry.  i browned a pound of chicken breast strips and followed the directions.  it was a quick and easy dinner for the family and everyone enjoyed it.  the ingredients come in 4 different packets - the pasta (orzo i think), seasonings, dehyrated broccoli and velveeta cheese sauce.  after browning the chicken, just add the seasoning and pasta along with about 2 1/2 cups of water and cover.  in about 7 or 8 minutes, add the dehydrated broccoli and cook another 2-3 minutes.  then remove from heat and add the cheese sauce.  my kids loved it and there was plenty for everyone.  i found it to be better tasting than chicken helper and easier to prepare.  my only complaint was the miniscule amount of broccoli.  it was more like a sprinkling of dried parsley than broccoli florets.  of course, you can always add your own fresh or frozen broccoli or other veggies to make it healthier and heartier.  overall, a good choice for a hectic night when you don't have much time to cook and a lot of hungry little mouths to feed.</td>

      <td>wow, we've never had so much macaroni and cheese in a long time! and annie's is really, really good. this doesn't need additional milk or butter, and the sauce is an easy-to-squeeze out paste in a foil package. it tastes great, and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tips to enjoy it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- just boil in plenty of water, the six-cup requirement is a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- drain quickly, put the pasta back in the hot pot. the remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni. don't rinse the pasta in cold water, it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- all the deluxe versions are animal rennet free. annie's faq is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet (not all do) but amazon isn't picking up the information. i tag the really vegetarian ones "animal rennet-free" whenever i can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- try blending sundried tomatoes, a fresh tomato, olive oil, garlic, pizza peppers, salt, freshly ground pepper, and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste. this really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new, gourmet taste that still doesn't take away from the "mac and cheesiness" of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- tabasco chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous. the smoky taste is tempered by the creaminess.</td>

      <td>i have been drinking powdered cocoa for nearly 40 years.  i consider myself pretty familiar with the powdered/add water-type cocoas and most of them taste like sand.  they are gritty and are either too sweet or far too bitter or have no real flavor at all (and stay in a thick lump at the bottom of the mug no matter how much you stir with a spoon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in nearly 40 years, i have only found two brands of cocoa that did not taste like gritty sludge (e.g., swiss miss, carnation, nestle's).  one powdered cocoa is from the lds church and it's almost impossible to get in kentucky.  the distribution center is in indianapolis and none of the wards here seem to have anyone who holds the calling of preparation specialist; therefore, no one goes to indy very often.  the second great cocoa was made by cold stone creamery.  it was sold through walmart and was as smooth as the church cocoa.  unfortunately, walmart no longer stocks it.  i'm not sure it's even manufactured any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yesterday i ran across stevens cocoa.  it was on the shelf for $1.00 (that's right -- a measly buck) so i decided to try it.  i knew that if i didn't like it, i could take it to work and give it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i'm in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff is equally as good as the cocoa from the lds church and cold stone creamery.  one sip and i was hooked. it dissolves well, it's not overly sweet, it has a nice mild flavor and it's just downright good.  i top it with redi-whip for fun but it doesn't need it, it's good without any help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i'm headed back to stock up on more cans.  if it disappears from the shelves in a couple of weeks, it's nice to know i can get it from amazon.  i never thought i'd fall in love with a product enough to buy it from amazon when the supply dried up on the shelves but i'm making an exception for this cocoa.  it's worth it.</td>

"you got anything to drink?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"yeah!" he replied. "i've got some lavender soda in the fridge."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"lavender soda?" i asked, skeptical. "where does a person even get lavender soda?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"it was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of marshall's, so i bought it." brian replied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as i typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. however, i would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience i had hoped it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i took my first sip, i thought to myself, "what have i gotten myself into this time?" the initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. "interesting," i thought. "perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first." however, as my drinking experience continued, i came to realize that this would not be the case. after i swallowed the soda, i was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. like a bar of soap was in my mouth. this brought back horrible memories of my childhood...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you see, when i was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to "wash my mouth out with soap" if i either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. being one to always question my mother's conviction, i often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. this had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later i can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when i consider saying a bad word. consequently, when i took my first taste of lavender soda, i was hit with a flood of emotions. i felt as though i had said a bad word or broken a rule. i felt as though i was being punished for something but could not recall what i had done. my vision began to become cloudy. i began to lose control of my small motor functions. i was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. i vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as i shall live, lest i suffer another episode such as the one described above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. it might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but i, personally, do not prefer it.</td>

      <td>this cake was super easy to make. it tasted great and had an absolutly awesome texture. the "mouth feel" of the cake is nothing like most microwaved treats. even people who regularly eat wheat would be very surprised this is a wheat free and microwave product give the taste and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; the texture is very soft and light and not at all grainy. the cake tastes like a cinnamon donut in terms of degree of sweetness and the cinnnamon flavor is very authentic and high quality tasting. the cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art. if you are giving it as a special treat to someone, as a birthday cake for instance, you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this would be a great purchase to keep in the pantry as an "emergency treat" or to keep at work as a courtesy maybe if you are doing a birthday and it turns out someone is on a gluten free diet. really what this kit is perfect for is when you are at a motel with a microwave, to send with a child going on a sleepover at someone else's house, or to leave with grandparents as an easy treat to give gluten free grandchildren.</td>

      <td>i am really thrilled with this product.  i wanted to be able to make oatmeal in my slow cooker so that it was warm and ready in the morning with no hassles. i have done so in the past with old fashioned rolled oats and the outcome was always less than satisfactory no matter what adjustments i made to the water/oats ratio.  this attempt turned out perfectly the very first time, which most likely has to do with the 'cut' of the grain.  the ratio is 1 cup oats to 4 cups water on low for 8 hours (and 1 cup of dried fruit).  i added about 1/4 cup of quinoa and a total of 1 1/4 cups dried fruit (craisins, tart cherries, and goji berries) and 1 good sized diced braeburn apple...no sugars.  i didn't use the spray 'pam' product it tells you to put in the crock, but coated it with organic coconut oil which is solid at room temperature.  it was amazing...no sweetening needed to enhance the flavors.  my husband eats oatmeal every day and he really liked it too.</td>

(not to mention the fact that most canned pastes would make the food taste worse, not better.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are only two mysteries about this product for me. first, a 1 1/2 tablespoon serving has 2 grams of fat. no other tomato pastes i looked at contain fat. since the ingredients are only tomato paste and salt, i have to wonder where this fat comes from. the second mystery is that they label the box as "double concentrated." as far as i can tell, it's no more concentrated than any other tomato paste: i still have to use exactly the same amount in a recipe, it just tastes better than the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i'll forgive amore the mysterious fat and exaggerated labeling. this has become a cooking essential in my kitchen.</td>

      <td>narnia???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i first had turkish delight while i was in turkey.  there, shops produce turkish delight and hundreds of other exotic treats fresh.  every town of more than a few thousand people seems to have at least one of these shops. the sweetness of turkish delight varies by shop in its native homeland, and this confection is a fine example, so long as one doesn't eat all that sugar sifting around in the box.  i think there's so much so it will act as a natural preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you can't fit a quick trip turkey to get the genuine article hand-made fresh, then this is the best imported substitute i've tried.  i wouldn't trust getting something like this from a regular retailer because of potential shelf-life issues, and i wouldn't trust confections obtained from a discount clothing outlet, but on-line through amazon i trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tangentially, if you like turkish delight, you owe it to yourself to visit the country of origin, because there's many other delicious turkish confections you probably haven't experienced.</td>

      <td>i've had instant and canned teas in the past and was less than impressed with those products, so i was hoping for something better with the mio sweet tea.  at first i got the mixture wrong-- i put 1 tsp into 8 ounces of water.  there was too much of a citrus-like after taste, and of course the flavor in general was too strong.  once i got the mixture right (use 1/2 tsp for every 8oz), my opinion changed.  the flavor is great, and i love it!  the 24 servings of this product were gone in no time, as i made 16 ounce servings frequently.  i imagine the liquid would easily stain clothing, so be careful as you squirt it out, but otherwise i have no reservations in recommending this.</td>

      <td>i've been feeding wellness grain free for a couple years now with great results for my 3 cats. i believe the cost of a top quality food is well worth it in healthy, happy cats and reduced vet bills, but still the cost of wellness has been prohibitive. i was excited to see felidae had a grain free formula in the larger sized cans, and for a much lower price, so i am trying it. just switched them over this week, so far so good. the bowls have been licked clean, and while i questioned the whole peas when i saw them, they weren't left in the bowl. the ingredients and quality of the felidae seems comparable to the wellness, so unless i find information indicating otherwise (and i've been looking), i think we'll stick with felidae.</td>

      <td>i bought this product from target after i had done what i thought was enough research on baby food makers.  i was originally going to get the baby bullet, but the reviews were not good at all so i went with the brezza instead.  mistake.  i remember that a few people had written about the poor quality and bad customer service (of the company itself, not amazon).  when i opened it, the tape used to secure it within the plastic bag was melted so there was sticky stuff all over the bottom of the thing.  i had to scrub it as soon as i took it out of the box, after it had gotten sticky melted tape all over my kitchen counter.  that was annoying. the plastic covering over the buttons looked like it was lifting (as if it had been used or something...even though it was brand new).  i tried the motor and it worked, it wasn't terribly loud, i'd probably rate the noise a 4 on a 1-10 scale.  when i went to wash it (prior to first use of course), the directions said to remove the driveshaft prior to washing.  it said all you had to do was to turn the canister over, find the knob, and turn counter clock-wise.  that driveshaft must've been welded in there bc it took me and my husband over an hour to loosen it enough to get it out of there.  i was honestly scared to put it back in for fear that i'd never get it back out again!  i got over it and prepared to make my first meal (carrots).  i followed the directions and cut up the carrots to the appropriate size but when i went to put the water in, there was a discrepancy.  the directions said to put in "160ml of water" and that the canister had a premeasured line that could be used so the amount of water would be correct.  normally that wouldn't be a problem...except that the measured line read 180ml.  seriously?!?  so, i'm left trying to figure out which one is correct.  i ended up going with the premeasured canister...and i think that it was too much water bc the carrots came out ridiculously watery.  there were also still chunks of carrot in the mix.  it wasn't easy to get the food out around the blades, either.  i can see how people would say that it might be a time saver.  if it worked and was of decent quality then it would save time.  you just set it and walk away.  but the end result leaves much to be desired.  and for the price, you'd expect to at least get your money's worth.  you're honestly better off just getting a really nice food processor and going the old fashioned way.</td>

      <td>during my recent visit to new orleans in june of 2012, i fell in love with etouffee' sauce on redfish.  oh my goodness. delicious.  i picked up a few packages of the louisiana cajun etouffee mix, for $2.00 per package, and made it at home. it was fantastic.  i ordered the product on amazon from a particular seller and for the price of more than 7 dollars, was delivered one package. the product description on the website did not clarify the number of packages to be delivered for this amount...i assumed three packages for that price. i received one package and returned it to them immediately.  you can purchase this product on line from the retailer for less than two dollars per package with free shipping.  so, avoid purchasing this via this seller.  great product however.</td>

      <td>i made prunes a permanent part of my diet because (a) they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants, and (b) because they're very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings. they're also supposed to be good, um, um, against constipation, so be careful. i usually eat a couple at a time, and never more than four; never a problem within these limits. they're nice to add to oatmeal too, along with bananas and raisins (or instead of raisins). raisins are also a good antioxidant, in fact, second best after prunes, about half as strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i've tried many kinds of prunes and so far sunsweet are the best: i like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (i do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. this page wants thirty? well, this must be some sort of error... i expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what i can get locally. so, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. in fact, i got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and  next month will jack up the price by 50%. it's a racket, so stay clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. just discovered: trader joe's carries pitted prunes too: a resealable plastic bag holds one pound (16 oz) and costs two-eighty-nine. that's about one tenth of what this guy above wants. bemuzing, to say the least.</td>

      <td>for just about $10, this canister gives you about 150-180 cups of coffee. that is just over a nickel a cup- you can't beat that! that means that for the same money as "premium" coffees like starbucks or seattle's best, you can get 80 cups (assuming $4 a cup). if you took $4 a day for 5 days a week, for a year, you would be spending $1000 just on coffee alone, money you can save for a car or down payment.  even if the starbucks tastes a little better, is it really worth it?  this coffee does not taste as good as premium, but it does not taste bad either. so coffee afficionados would not be as let down as they think (and honestly that starbucks via stuff is way too expensive at $1 a cup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;granted, instant is not as good as a really fresh cup of freshly ground coffee, but it tastes better than most coffee, because most coffee is not freshly ground (especially the pre-ground coffee in bricks or cans).  because freeze dried retains freshness a longer time if it is kept air-sealed, you get a fresh cup almost every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are only two big downsides to the 7 ounce containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. first, by the time you get to the bottom of the canister, you might experience some staleness. this is because of exposure to air, which affects even freeze-dried coffee. one possible solution is to seal small batches and keep them away from light and heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. it is easy to add too much instant coffee to a cup. it only takes a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half for one cup, nothing more.  it only takes a little to make a cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, nescafe taster's choice offers a great balance between cost savings and taste. is it as good as fresh brewed? perhaps not, especially if you can get freshly ground coffee that you make yourself.  but it is certainly better than most coffee you get at, say, a diner or restaurant.  cafes make it better, but at $4+ a cup, they are not worth it unless just as an occasional indulgence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you are one of those people who has always scoffed at instant, i'd say at least give this a try.</td>

      <td>this coffee has become my morning ritual because in my opinion it is the best coffee pod for the price out there, though i haven't tried the other melitta roasts (those are next on my list). it is so dark and rich, with a chocolate taste and a great body- reminds me of a good americano (blows a starbucks americano out of the water). i've found the best method to getting the best out of this pod is to brew it using about 7 ounces of water with my bunn mc pod brewer, on the 'tea' setting. this makes a very strong brew, so i add about 2 or 3 ounces of hot water to round it out. my only complaint about these pods is the consistency. it seems like i get a bad, bitter tasting pod here and there. there is also kind of a dry aftertaste. but in all honesty, it could be something i'm not doing right in the brewing process. i'm only taking off one star since i don't know what the issue is. otherwise, i'm very very pleased with this coffee. i've not felt the need to go to a coffee shop since i purchased it. i will definitely be buying again.</td>

(wagging finger at amazon!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think for now i will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;heavens to besty, this stuff rocks!! it is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as i have def shopped around.  i have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  kudos to alive and aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!&lt;br /&gt;i am not a raw foodie per say, but i try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, i think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  it is loaded with antioxidants, as you probably know.  so go ahead, get the big bag.  you can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food "of the gods" (theobroma) as they say :)&lt;br /&gt;my favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- i just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, i know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how i love it!), add just enough sweetener (i like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked i top it off with a spoonful of evo coconut oil- yumm!!! i have converted everyone, even the kids i babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). or i make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  you better believe it goes fast!!  i love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins a, d and the x- factor (read weston a price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry i am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!&lt;br /&gt;also process it with evo coconut oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  i often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.&lt;br /&gt;go for it! buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. i guarantee!!  peace be with you!</td>

      <td>i had recently tried a similar product from trader joe's and, not having a tj's around me presently, i decided to try this more readily-available variation.  i didn't really like this thing too much.  for starters, there is too much packaging for my liking.  too many things to throw away.  and i agree with a previous reviewer that they're kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  then you have to add water.  they give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  then microwave for 3 minutes.  then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  the one from trader joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  and those are a lot tastier.  i didn't like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didn't have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning i put in.  time to try a couple of the other brands of these things...</td>

      <td>this product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. do not let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. this mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested gluten free product. it lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. as with many gluten free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding "something" to try to make it right. to these, i had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. i added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. this mix takes too much "doctoring" to be recommended at all until hodgson mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. but, hodgson mill does have other good products. try their blueberry muffin mix and hope that one day amazon will carry a wider array of their gluten free offerings as many are very, very good.</td>

(the earth's best rep did say that they were doing "accelerated testing" of bpa-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is such a shame, because earth's best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies &amp; carbs/starch) in puree form.  all the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as plum, sprout, ella's kitchen, etc., only make stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  earth's best does make some baby food in bpa-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its dinner line.  i was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.  but i guess i'll have to wait until she's old enough for stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.  (virtually impossible for this super-busy and domestically-challenged mom, lol!)</td>

      <td>i bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "beneful" i thought i was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. my dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients i completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. the first three ingredients are ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. how disgusting is that?! the main ingredient is a corn filler. one thing my vet told me a while back that i never forgot: "when you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? the same thing happens with dogs." basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. the only meat in beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! by-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. we're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! i would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. it is an absolutely awful dog food. i can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend to stay far away from beneful, and most purina products. when purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. now that i know what to look for, i usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as blue buffalo, halo or wellness.</td>

(he would barely touch purina little bites) i took him out of state to my mom's place and he pooped in the house 3 times! i took the blame for not paying enough attention to him. however, since we've come back home he's pooped in my apt 3 times! (in 1 week) he never does that. i thought that maybe he was being spiteful, but i really think he just can't help it. the food is one hell of a laxative if thats what you're looking for. i'm glad i only bought the small bag because i will not be giving this one another try. it only gets 2 stars because he likes it and because i'm sure he would lose weight if he keeps pooping this much. terrible.</td>

      <td>while orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink,  the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation.  i think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients (tangerine is third) is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste. finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail.  to my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;while the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely "natural" sugar in this or most any juice.  the healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit.  fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.</td>

      <td>little lesson on truffles...&lt;br /&gt;truffles graded "extra" are larger than most, the second highest in truffle quality. best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. whole -entire truffles- are marked "brushed" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in brine or truffle juice -which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths -and are ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add visual truffle appeal to dishes. however, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. they are great to use with truffle oil - the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle "look", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;note: preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost no flavor or odor. if you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. if you're looking to add a truffle look only to your dish, then this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;better to buy real truffle oil &amp; experiment, for example "jr mushrooms &amp; specialties" on amazon, is a good start--about 10 dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil (evoo).</td>

      <td>i write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  on friday morning, february 25, 2011, i was awakened by the screams of my fianc&amp;eacute;e lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling greta, our 2 ¬ω year-old registered female pug.  greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a purina busy bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i'm left wondering how purina, a company with a name as iconic as betty crocker, bayer, gerber and general mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as i've since discovered on the internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  i find this absolutely appalling.  i'm 57 years-old and i've put my trust in purina products since i was a child.  and now our beloved greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  and lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  she's simply devastated - and angry.  and so am i.&lt;br /&gt; did you know that in the united states its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  are you familiar with the westminster kennel club dog show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for "best in show," including the chinese pug?  do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?&lt;br /&gt; i could talk about the money we paid for greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  and there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  i find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the kroger store from which we purchased your killing busy bone.&lt;br /&gt; i have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  i visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  he certainly appreciates those visits.  but he also has a fulltime companion - spencer, his jack russell terrier.  spencer will turn 12 in may.  dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the cleveland clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  and i believe if it weren't for the loving attention spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  his dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  something which purina has stolen away from us.  you'd think that purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  but tragically that's not the case.&lt;br /&gt; yet there's more.  we also have a male pug which we named winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of winston churchill.  winston, like greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  and like us, he's now subdued.  he's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  this concerns me.&lt;br /&gt; i am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  i work with the general public and i have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  as a result of losing greta, all i can think about now is me handing her a busy bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  the guilt is killing me.  how can i write?  how can i do anything?  grief passes they say.  but tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  and what makes things worse in this case is that greta's death could have been prevented.&lt;br /&gt; though both winston and greta liked the busy bone, several times in the past greta had gagged on it.  so, i served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation i assumed resolved the problem.  in retrospect i should have responded more to the concerns lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  in a brief moment, while we were in another room, greta died because of your product.  and why should such a product even exist?  why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  why didn't purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?&lt;br /&gt; the answer is self-evident: gross negligence.  a negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in lori's and my life.  we'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  i lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even i, a writer, cannot express in words.  it's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  we are utterly distraught.  greta, only 2 ¬ω years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  it's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to purina.&lt;br /&gt; the very least purina can do is pull all forms of the busy bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any purina product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; karl and lori&lt;br /&gt; former owners of beloved greta, purebred female pug.  our baby.  gone forever.</td>

[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from the article:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;parents may be buying [similac organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring similac organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. it is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no health problems in babies have been associated with similac organic. but to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity.</td>

      <td>we breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. we started with similac advance (shield plus) which we still had from hospital. first 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to similac organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-ounce bottle i began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. breast milk and similac advance tested similarly sweet, but similac organic was much much less sweet. i made a research on the internet and i found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/encymaster/c/constipation_infant.html)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;constipation means infrequent, hard stools. it does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. so the first question to ask is, "is my child really constipated?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. the normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. that is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. it is just that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased "motility," we say)&lt;br /&gt;  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces&lt;br /&gt;  * a combination of the above two factors&lt;br /&gt;  * there is obstruction of the lower gi tract&lt;br /&gt;  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - hirschprung disease&lt;br /&gt;  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation&lt;br /&gt;  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. this is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. the stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. and of course a lot of noisy gas. but these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. it is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. by then we are really discussing toddlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. this worries some parents. despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. go figure. they forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. when the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. the baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. just as mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. hence the grunting and red-faced straining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  the other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. if one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, i have mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. the anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.&lt;br /&gt;top&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottle fed infants are "a whole 'nother story." infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (the exception to this rule in my mind is the new similac¬æ that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) so true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. the residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. it is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. cereal + milk = concrete. cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.&lt;br /&gt;top&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;  * i use a lot of karo¬æ corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. it is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. i start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. usually, the baby can be weaned off the karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. it is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. the excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. the excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  before scolding me about "the risk of botulism" from corn syrup, please see:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  clinical pediatric emergency medicine, volume 4,number 3,september 2003: "pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  "in the past, c. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  for the complete source of statement, see: olsen sj, swerdlow dl. risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. in reply. pediatr infect dis j 2000;19:584-5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. they can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.&lt;br /&gt;  * lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. we use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. the dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.&lt;br /&gt;  * glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. the suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. the act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)&lt;br /&gt;  * fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (i believe isoyalac¬æ, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. it was never very available any place i practiced, anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;top&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * iron in the formula causes constipation. no way. i can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. but the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  the irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. the problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (karo¬æ, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;top</td>
